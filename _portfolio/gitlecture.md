No one is exempt from the pain of suffering, nor do they flee from it, but because the consequence of great pain leads those who do not know the reason for it.

Nor is there anyone who would have the right to claim relief for the pain of being, but the person may suffer from it, thus we seek out great joy or comfort in the process of work and pain.

For the sake of minimal things, we do not give up on the laborious nature of working for ourselves, unless we achieve a result that we can rely upon.

Who would not want a just person to be free of suffering or the kind of distress that is inflicted upon them by that very nature?"
