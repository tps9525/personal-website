"But how does this all come about? It arises from the understanding of how every occurrence stems from a cause, with even the smallest error or difficulty serving as a point of reflection. The entire matter is revealed, including the truths crafted by inventors and the architects of a fulfilled life, as expressed in their words and actions.

No one truly desires pain or fleeting joy, but rather the pursuit of something lasting. <a>Because delight often comes with challenges</a>, there are those who endure the hardships and uncertainties that arise, accepting them as part of the journey.

There is no one who loves pain for painâ€™s sake, or seeks it out solely for what it is. Instead, difficulties are endured <a>when circumstances arise</a>, so that meaningful work and achievements can be pursued. To this end, who among us would not take on even the most laborious tasks, if it leads to something beneficial?

Who then, can find satisfaction in justice, or take joy in actions devoid of harm, <a>while embracing difficulties</a>? Only the one who seeks not empty pleasure, but rather the fulfillment that comes from meaningful effort."
