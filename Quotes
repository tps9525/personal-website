If there is no peace in the minds of individuals, how can there be peace in the world? Make peace in your own mind first.
The only conversion involved in Vipassana is from misery to happiness, from bondage to liberation.
When one experiences truth, the madness of finding fault with others disappears.
S. N. Goenka
